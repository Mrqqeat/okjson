This is a json parser, written in ruby.
It has no dependencies other than ruby.

This library is intended to be "vendored".
It is not a gem; instead, copy okjson.rb
into your project and "require" it directly.
This method helps you avoid an external
dependency. It's only about 530 lines of
source; about half of that is UTF-8 coding.

OkJson is not particularly fast or flexible,
but it is designed to be simple and portable.
It should suffice for most needs.

Patches to increase the correctness,
readability, or portability of the
source code will be gratefully accepted.
Other patches likely won't.


To Test:

  $ ./test
  $ RUBY=rbx ./test

(Note: these tests originated at
https://github.com/genki/json
but have been changed to follow
RFC 4627 and revised substantially.)


To Use:

  OkJson.encode({"abc" => [123, -456.789]})
  => "{\"abc\":[123,-456.789]}"

  OkJson.decode('{"abc":[123,-456.789e0]}')
  => {"abc"=>[123, -456.789]}

That's it.
